/**
 * Which vault folder a session belongs in (R-27.1, R-H2).
 *
 * The rule that matters: **the collection is the repository, not the folder.**
 * Before this, a session run in `bb2dash-wt-sl` filed itself under a collection
 * called `bb2dash-wt-sl`, so one project's history scattered across as many
 * "projects" as it had worktrees. Every worktree of `emstacho-su/bb2dash` now
 * resolves to `bb2dash`.
 *
 * First, a cwd inside one of Claude Code's own folders (`~/.claude/projects/
 * <encoded>/…`, a scratchpad under `<tmp>/claude/<encoded>/…`) is decoded back
 * to the cwd it was made for, and the repository is resolved again from there
 * (claude-paths.mjs). Then the first rule of ROUTING_RULES that places it wins:
 *   1. class-folder — cwd passes through a directory that exists under
 *      `vault/classes/`, so `…/.fall2026/ist352` is `classes/ist352`;
 *   2. harness — the harness repo (worktrees included), `~/.claude` or
 *      `~/.harness` go to `harness/agentic-harness`, when this vault holds the
 *      `harness` realm; without it they fall through to the rules below, as
 *      before the realm existed;
 *   3. container — `~/projects` itself, the folder of projects, is `misc`;
 *   4. git — `https://github.com/emstacho-su/bb2dash.git` is
 *      `projects/bb2dash`, flagged `collection_source: git`;
 *   5. folder — the folder name, flagged `collection_source: folder`, preferring
 *      an ancestor that already owns a vault folder (in whichever area it is)
 *      so a session run in `agentic-harness/ingest` is not filed under `ingest`.

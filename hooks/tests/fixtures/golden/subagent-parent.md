# Session 2026-09-16 — bb2dash

Working directory `__SANDBOX__/repos/bb2dash`. Ran 45m, 1 prompt, 1 shell command, 4 files touched. Ended: clear.

## What I asked for

1. Spawn two workers: one to finish the retrieval filter, one to review the migration. Report back when both land.

## Files created or modified

- `db/migrations/035_transform_driver.sql`
- `docs/planning/50_PHASE7_retrieval_polish.md`
- `web/src/lib/retrieval/filter.ts`
- `web/test/filter.test.ts`

## Commands run

1 shell invocation. Sample:

- Run the retrieval filter test

## Delegated work

- Agent: Finish the retrieval filter (general-purpose)
- Agent: Review the migration (feature-dev:code-reviewer)

## Outcome

_The assistant's closing message, verbatim._

> Both workers reported; the brief is updated.

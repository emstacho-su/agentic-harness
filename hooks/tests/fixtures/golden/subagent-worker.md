# Subagent general-purpose 2026-09-16 — bb2dash

Working directory `__SANDBOX__/repos/bb2dash`. Ran 28m, 1 prompt, 1 shell command, 2 files touched. Ended: other.

## What I asked for

1. Add the superseded-file filter to the retrieval path and cover it with a test. The service key is [REDACTED-KEY] if you need it.

## Files created or modified

- `web/src/lib/retrieval/filter.ts`
- `web/test/filter.test.ts`

## Commands run

1 shell invocation. Sample:

- Run the retrieval filter test

## Outcome

_The assistant's closing message, verbatim._

> Filter is in and the test passes.

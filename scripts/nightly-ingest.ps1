.SYNOPSIS
    The nightly reconcile: conclude stale sessions, then re-ingest the vault.

.DESCRIPTION
    Three steps, in this order and for this reason:

      0. transcript sweep — hooks/sweep-transcripts.mjs writes a note for every
         idle transcript under ~/.claude/projects that has none: SDK workers,
         sessions killed with their terminal, teleported cloud sessions.
      0b. checkpoints    — hooks/collect-checkpoints.mjs fetches the notes the
         /checkpoint skill pushed from cloud sessions and files them in the vault.
      1. sweep-concluded  — sets status: concluded and concluded_at on session
         notes still 'active' more than 24 h after their ended_at (R-27.2).
      2. ingest           — a full walk of the vault, which picks up the notes
         the sweeps just wrote along with anything the per-note hook missed.

    Running the sweep first is what makes the status change visible to search in
    the same night. The other way round, every concluded note would wait a day.

    The sweep touches frontmatter only, and content_hash is over the body, so
    the ingest reaches those notes through its metadata-only path: it compares
    the stored title and metadata with the freshly parsed ones and issues one
    UPDATE, with no re-chunking and no embedding. They are counted in the run
    summary as 'metadata-updated'.

    A complete ingest writes its own last-success timestamp, which is what
    `ingest --health` reads. This script does not write that file; a run that
    fails must not look like a run that worked.

    Registered by register-nightly-ingest.ps1. Safe to run by hand.

.PARAMETER VaultPath
    The Obsidian vault. Must be a Windows path (C:/...), not an MSYS /c/... one.

.PARAMETER ProjectDir
    The uv project holding the ingest package (the directory with pyproject.toml).

.PARAMETER SweepMode
    Apply   - write the concluded status (the point of the nightly run)
    DryRun  - report what it would conclude, change nothing
    Skip    - do not sweep at all

.EXAMPLE
    ./nightly-ingest.ps1 -SweepMode DryRun

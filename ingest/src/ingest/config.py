      means a chunk can pick up a heading breadcrumb and a carried-over overlap
      block without tipping into silent truncation by the tokenizer.
    * ``overlap_tokens=64`` — one sixth of a chunk. Enough that a sentence split
      across a boundary is retrievable from either side, small enough that
      storage and embedding cost only rise ~17%.
    * ``min_tokens=32`` — chunks shorter than this are merged into their
      neighbour. Sub-30-token fragments (a lone heading, a one-line list item)
      embed to near-noise and pollute the top-k.
    * ``hard_max_tokens=480`` — absolute ceiling after breadcrumb + overlap are
      added. Still under 512, so nothing is ever truncated by the model.

"""The one pipeline both loaders feed.

hash -> skip-if-unchanged -> chunk -> embed -> transactional upsert

Change detection happens before chunking and embedding, so a re-run over an
unchanged corpus does no model work and issues no writes at all.

The hash is over the **body**. Frontmatter therefore needs its own comparison:
a resume flipping ``status`` to ``superseded``, a ``child_sessions`` link, or
``sweep-concluded --apply`` writing ``status`` and ``concluded_at`` changes
metadata and nothing else, and would otherwise sit behind the unchanged
short-circuit forever. Such a document takes the metadata-only path — one
UPDATE, no re-chunking and no embedding — and is counted separately.

Widening the hash to cover frontmatter would be the other way to catch it, and
would re-embed every document in the store the first time it ran.

A session note's retrievals (R-P2) ride along: after any write they are
re-projected into ``rag.retrieval_events``, and on an unchanged note the stored
row count is compared with the note's, so a re-run writes nothing and a table
migrated after the note was stored is filled on the next run.

    Every column the upsert writes apart from the body and its hash, because

    moves between folders keeps its body, and a stale collection is invisible —

    ``metadata`` is compared as canonical JSON, so jsonb's key ordering — which

"""Orphan sweep.

After a *complete* ingest of one source, any ``external_id`` still in
``rag.documents`` that the loader did not produce is an orphan — a deleted note,
or a note renamed while it had no stable frontmatter ``id:``.

This is the only destructive operation in the package, so it is off by default
and refuses to run unless the sweep can be trusted:

* the run must have been a full pass — ``--limit`` truncates the seen set, so a
  sweep after one would delete most of the corpus;
* no document may have failed — a failure means the seen set is incomplete;
* the loader must have produced something — an empty vault (a mistyped path, an
  unmounted OneDrive folder) would otherwise wipe the source.

A row written after the walk began is never an orphan, however the run ends: it
belongs to a note captured while the run embedded (a SessionEnd hook ingests its
own note at once), which the walk had no chance to see. ``written_before`` holds
that cutoff; both the listing and the delete test it, so a row rewritten between
the two statements is kept. Such rows are reported as spared; the next run sees
their notes.

Each guard reports why it declined. Nothing is ever deleted silently.

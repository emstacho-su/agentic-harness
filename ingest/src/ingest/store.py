The pipeline talks to the :class:`ChunkStore` protocol, so the tests run against
an in-memory fake and never need a database. :class:`PostgresStore` is the real

Write model: one transaction per document. Upsert on ``(source, external_id)``,
delete that document's chunks, insert the new ones. If anything in that sequence
fails the document keeps its previous chunks — never a half-rewritten document.

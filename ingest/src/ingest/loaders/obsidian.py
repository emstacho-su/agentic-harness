"""Obsidian vault loader.

Walks a vault directory for markdown, splits YAML frontmatter from the body, and
emits one :class:`SourceDocument` per note.

* ``source``      = ``obsidian``
* ``external_id`` = the note's frontmatter ``id:`` when it has one, else the
  vault-relative POSIX path (``notes/ideas/rag.md``), so a note keeps the same
  identity whether it is ingested from Windows or WSL.

  Prefer an ``id:`` in notes you expect to move. With a path-based key a rename
  is indistinguishable from delete-plus-create: the old row is stranded and a
  duplicate appears. A stable ``id:`` survives the rename.
* ``agent``       = ``claude-code``
* ``metadata``    = the frontmatter verbatim, plus an ``_ingest`` sub-object.
  Ingest-added keys are nested under ``_ingest`` so they can never collide with
  a user's own frontmatter key named ``path`` or ``source``.

Opting out. A note with frontmatter ``ingest: false`` stays in the vault for
reading and linking but is never embedded. Class materials exported from bb2dash
use this: their retrieval belongs to the bb2dash store, and embedding them here
would put gte-small content into a bge-small index (CONTEXT.md). Opt-outs are
reported as skips, never hidden.

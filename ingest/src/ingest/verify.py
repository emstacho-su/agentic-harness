"""The store audit's data: findings, reports, the rows it reads, and the reader protocol.

``uv run ingest verify`` (R-Q1) asks whether the store is chunked and embedded
properly — a property of the rows, not of the code that wrote them. This module
holds the shapes only; the checks are pure functions in :mod:`verify_checks`, the
SQL lives in :mod:`verify_store` and the command line in :mod:`verify_cli`.
